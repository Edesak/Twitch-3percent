# Twitch-3percent
This is mini "demo" that will compute your percentage portion on screen. 

Again Hello, this is really small program that will take and compute your screen. Simple set your resolution click compute drag the area and you have the asnwer. 
You can even load some image and set your resolution and get the answer. Be careful tho. When you change the size in OBS it isn't original image size. 

**If you read it to this line i just want to say thank you and go to hell twitch :)**
